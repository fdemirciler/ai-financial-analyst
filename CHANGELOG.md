## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Modular Tool System**: Chose a plugin-based architecture for analysis tools to enable easy extension and maintenance.

2. **Session-Based State Management**: Implemented in-memory session storage for development simplicity, with clear path to database integration for production.

3. **Async-First Design**: Built with async/await throughout for optimal performance and scalability.

4. **Pydantic Integration**: Used Pydantic for all data validation and configuration management for type safety and automatic documentation.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implemented integration tests covering the complete user journey to ensure reliability.

### Future Considerations

- Database integration for persistent session storage
- Advanced caching mechanisms for repeated queries
- Horizontal scaling support
- Additional LLM provider integrations
- Real-time collaborative features
